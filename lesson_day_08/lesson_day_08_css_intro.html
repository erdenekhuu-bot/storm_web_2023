    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <div>
        The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an
        information design, dense plantings, and a mixture of omamental and
        edible plants.
    </div>

        The Cottage Garden originated in <i>England</i> and its history can be traced
        back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England
        when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured
        and rigorously maintained <i>English estate gardens</i>.

        The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,
        with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
