    <h3>Breed History</h3>
    <p>
        The biard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for 
        centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by French Army as 
        sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense 
        of hearing. Biards were used in First World War almost to the point of 
        extinction. Currently the population of biards is slowly recovering.
        Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, and Lafayette are all owned biards.
