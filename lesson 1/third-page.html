   <p>Welcome to My Exercise Plan!</p> 
<p>Are you ready to get started on your fitness journey?</p>
This simple exercise plan will help you build a foundation <p></p>
for a healthier and more active lifestyle. <p></p>

<p><b>Day 1: Walking</b></p>
<p>
    Start with a 15-minute brisk walk around your neighborhood
or a nearby park. Focus on maintaining good posture and breathing rhythmically.
</p>
<p><b>Day 2: Stretching</b></p>
<p>Perform a 10-minute stretching routine to improve flexibility.
    Include stretches for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and back.</p>

<p><b>Day 3: Squats</b></p>
<p>Do 3 sets of 10 squats. Squats are great for building lower body strength.
    Keep your back straight, and go as low as you comfortably can.</p>
<p><b>Day 4: Rest</b></p>
<p>Rest is essential for muscle recovery. Take a break today and focus on staying hydrated.</p>
<p><b>Day 5: Push-ups</b></p>
<p>Perform 3 sets of 5 push-ups. If regular push-ups are too challenging,
    start with knee push-ups and work your way up.</p>
<p><b>Day 6: Jumping Jacks</b></p>
<p>Do 3 sets of 15 jumping jacks. This is a great way to improve cardiovascular
    fitness and burn calories.</p>
<p><b>Day 7: Rest</b></p>
<p>Another day of rest to allow your body to recover. Focus on healthy eating
    and staying active by walking or stretching.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>Stay hydrated throughout your workouts.</p>
<p>Listen to your body; don't push too hard, especially if you're just starting out.</p>

<p>Consistency is key. Try to stick to your exercise plan and
    gradually increase intensity as you become more comfortable.</p>
<p>Consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any
    new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.</p>
